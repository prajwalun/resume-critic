# Judgment Framework Integration - Resume Agent

## 🎯 Overview

The Resume Agent now includes comprehensive **Judgment framework integration** that provides:

- **🔍 Judgment Tracing**: Full observability of all agent decisions and LLM calls
- **📊 Judgment Evaluation**: Quality metrics for resume improvements and agent decisions  
- **🔍 Judgment Monitoring**: Real-time monitoring of agent actions, errors, and patterns

## 🚀 Features Implemented

### 1. **Comprehensive Tracing**
- **All LLM calls** are automatically wrapped and traced
- **Agent decisions** are logged with full context
- **Iterative improvements** are tracked across multiple perspectives
- **User interactions** and clarifications are captured
- **Error handling** and verification failures are traced

### 2. **Quality Evaluation**
- **Section improvement metrics**: Structure, formatting, relevance, clarity
- **Agent decision evaluation**: Context, reasoning, confidence scoring
- **Before/after content comparison** with detailed analysis
- **Verification quality scoring** with penalty systems

### 3. **Real-time Monitoring**
- **Action logging**: All agent operations (analysis start, iterations, completions)
- **Error tracking**: Verification failures, fabrication detection, unusual patterns
- **Performance metrics**: Iteration counts, success rates, timing analysis
- **Alert system**: Unusual patterns (e.g., 5+ failed suggestions in a row)

## 🛠 Technical Implementation

### Core Components

#### 1. **Judgment Configuration** (`judgment_config.py`)
```python
# Main judgment instances
judgment = Tracer(project_name="resume-critic-ai", enable_monitoring=True)
evaluator = JudgmentEvaluator()
monitor = JudgmentMonitor()
```

#### 2. **Automatic LLM Wrapping**
```python
# OpenAI client automatically wrapped for tracing
from judgeval.common.tracer import wrap
self.client = wrap(AsyncOpenAI(api_key=api_key))
```

#### 3. **Method-level Tracing**
```python
@judgment.observe(name="iterative_section_improvement", span_type="chain")
async def _iterative_section_improvement(self, content, section_type, ...):
    # All method calls automatically traced
```

### Key Integration Points

#### 1. **Agent Analysis Tracing**
- **Session tracking**: Unique session IDs for each analysis
- **Section-by-section tracing**: Individual spans for skills, experience, education, projects
- **Iteration tracking**: Each improvement attempt logged with perspective and results

#### 2. **Quality Evaluation**
```python
# Section improvement evaluation
evaluator.evaluate_section_improvement(
    original_content=original,
    improved_content=improved,
    job_description=jd,
    section_type="skills",
    metric=ResumeMetrics.IMPROVEMENT_QUALITY
)

# Agent decision evaluation  
evaluator.evaluate_agent_decision(
    decision_context="Improving skills section",
    decision_made="Applied structured formatting",
    reasoning="Enhanced readability and categorization",
    confidence_score=0.85
)
```

#### 3. **Monitoring and Alerts**
```python
# Action monitoring
monitor.log_agent_action("section_analysis_started", {
    "section_type": section_type.value,
    "original_length": len(content),
    "timestamp": datetime.now().isoformat()
})

# Error tracking
monitor.log_error("verification_failure", {
    "section_type": "skills",
    "iteration": 1,
    "issues": [...]
})

# Pattern detection
monitor.log_unusual_pattern("5+ failed skills suggestions in a row")
```

## 📈 Metrics and Evaluation

## 🎯 Real-world Example

### Judgment Tracing in Action:
```
🔍 You can view your trace data here: View Trace

INFO: Agent action logged: analysis_started - {'session_id': 'a0b8c109-b24d-4fe1-945a-ff029397caa5'}
INFO: Starting iterative improvement for skills
INFO: Iteration 1/5 - Perspective: hiring_manager
WARNING: Iteration 1 rejected due to verification issues:
  - high: Suggested skills not in original: ['Kubernetes', 'AWS', 'Azure']
  - medium: Suggestion is 375% longer than original
ERROR: Agent error: verification_failure - {'section_type': 'skills', 'iteration': 1}
WARNING: Unusual pattern detected: 5+ failed skills suggestions in a row
```

### Evaluation Results:
```python
{
    'metric': 'improvement_quality',
    'original_length': 18,
    'improved_length': 60,
    'section_type': 'skills',
    'evaluation_submitted': True
}
```

### Monitoring Summary:
```python
{
    'total_errors': 8,
    'total_clarifications': 1,
    'total_iterations': 18,
    'failed_suggestions_by_section': {
        'skills': 5,
