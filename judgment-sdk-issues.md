# Judgment SDK Issues

This document contains issues identified while integrating Judgment SDK with a complex resume analysis agent system.

## Issue 1: Missing Session-Based Tracing API

**Title:** `Missing session-based tracing API for complex multi-step agent workflows`

**Description:**
I'm building a resume analysis agent that processes entire sessions with multiple sections (skills, education, experience, projects) in sequence. The current tracing API only supports individual function tracing, but I need session-level correlation to track the complete workflow and understand how different sections relate to each other.

**Problem:**
My agent has a complex workflow where it:
- Processes multiple sections in sequence
- Makes decisions at each step (accept/reject/retry)
- Sometimes pauses for human clarification
- Maintains session state throughout the process

Currently, I have to manually track session state and correlate traces:

```python
session = {
    "session_id": session_id,
    "created_at": datetime.now().isoformat(),
    "sections": parsed_sections,
    "job_analysis": job_analysis,
    "section_analyses": {},
    "accepted_changes": {},
    "needs_clarification": False,
    "pending_clarifications": {},
    "current_section_index": 0
}
```

**Expected Behavior:**
I was hoping for a session-level API that would let me correlate all the spans within a single session, something like:

```python
with judgment.session(session_id="resume_analysis_123") as session:
    session.add_metadata("total_sections", len(sections))
    session.correlate_spans("section_analysis")
    
    # All spans within this context would be correlated
    for section in sections:
        with session.span(f"analyze_{section.type}"):
            # This span would be part of the session
            analyze_section(section)
```

**Current Behavior:**
Only individual `@judgment.observe()` decorators are available, requiring manual session state management and correlation. This makes it difficult to:
- Track the complete session lifecycle
- Correlate related spans across different sections
- Understand session-level metrics and performance
- Debug issues that span multiple sections

**Impact:**
Without session-level tracing, I can't effectively monitor and debug complex agent workflows. This is particularly important for production systems where understanding the complete user journey is crucial.

## Issue 2: Missing Graceful Fallback for Missing Dependencies

**Title:** `Missing graceful fallback when judgeval dependencies are unavailable`

**Description:**
When deploying to production environments, I need my application to continue working even if Judgment services are unavailable (missing API keys, network issues, service downtime, etc.). Currently, the SDK throws ImportError and crashes the entire application, which is not acceptable for production systems.

**Problem:**
I had to implement fallback logic myself to prevent application crashes:

```python
try:
    from judgeval.common.tracer import wrap
    self.client = wrap(AsyncOpenAI(api_key=api_key))
    judgment = get_judgment_tracer()
    evaluator = get_judgment_evaluator()
except ImportError:
    # Graceful fallback when SDK not available
    self.client = AsyncOpenAI(api_key=api_key)
    logger.warning("Judgment framework not available - using fallback mode")
except Exception as e:
    # Handle other Judgment-related errors
    logger.warning(f"Judgment initialization failed: {str(e)} - using fallback mode")
    self.client = AsyncOpenAI(api_key=api_key)
```

**Expected Behavior:**
A built-in fallback mode that allows the application to continue functioning without Judgment features:

```python
judgment = Tracer(
    project_name="my_project",
    fallback_mode=True,  # Continue without Judgment features
    fallback_logging=True  # Log when falling back
)
```

Or at minimum, the SDK should handle missing dependencies gracefully without throwing ImportError.

**Current Behavior:**
- ImportError crashes the application when judgeval is not properly configured
- No built-in fallback mechanism
- Application becomes unusable if Judgment services are down

**Impact:**
This makes it risky to deploy to production environments where Judgment might not be available or properly configured. It also makes local development more difficult when Judgment credentials aren't set up.

## Issue 3: Missing Async Evaluation API for Non-Blocking Operations

**Title:** `Missing async evaluation API for non-blocking agent operations`

**Description:**
I'm building a resume analysis agent that needs to maintain sub-second response times for user experience. The current `async_evaluate()` function still blocks the main thread in some scenarios, preventing truly non-blocking evaluation in production agents.

**Problem:**
My agent needs to run evaluations without impacting user response times. I had to implement my own non-blocking evaluation pattern:

```python
def _trigger_judgment_evaluation(self, original_content, improved_content, section_type, job_analysis, primary_score, iteration):
    """JUDGMENT FRAMEWORK: Comprehensive async evaluation that doesn't block agent flow."""
    import asyncio
    
    # Run judgment evaluation asynchronously (non-blocking)
    asyncio.create_task(self._run_comprehensive_evaluation(
        original_content=original_content,
        improved_content=improved_content,
        section_type=section_type,
        job_analysis=job_analysis,
        primary_score=primary_score,
        iteration=iteration
    ))
```

**Expected Behavior:**
A truly fire-and-forget evaluation API that doesn't impact response times:

```python
# Option 1: Fire-and-forget API
judgment.fire_evaluate(
    scorers=[AnswerRelevancyScorer(threshold=0.5)],
    input=task_input,
    actual_output=res,
    model="gpt-4.1"
)

# Option 2: Background evaluation with callback
judgment.background_evaluate(
    scorers=[AnswerRelevancyScorer(threshold=0.5)],
    input=task_input,
    actual_output=res,
    model="gpt-4.1",
    callback=handle_evaluation_result
)
```

**Current Behavior:**
`async_evaluate()` can still cause delays, especially with:
- Complex evaluations with multiple scorers
- Slow Judgment service response times
- Network latency issues
- Large input/output data

**Impact:**
This prevents building truly responsive agents that need to maintain fast user experience while still getting the benefits of comprehensive evaluation.

## Issue 4: Missing Human-in-the-Loop Tracing Support

**Title:** `Missing tracing support for human-in-the-loop agent workflows`

**Description:**
My resume agent pauses for human input when it detects potential fabrication risks or needs clarification. The current tracing API doesn't handle these pause/resume scenarios properly, making it difficult to track the complete workflow.

**Problem:**
When my agent pauses for user clarification, the traces break or become disconnected:

```python
if fabrication_risk['needs_clarification']:
    # How do we trace this pause for user input?
    request_clarification()
    continue  # Resume processing after user input
```

This creates fragmented traces that are hard to debug and monitor.

**Expected Behavior:**
Tracing should support pause/resume patterns for human-in-the-loop workflows:

```python
# Option 1: Pause/resume context managers
with judgment.pause_for_human_input(reason="clarification_needed"):
    user_response = await get_user_clarification()
    
with judgment.resume_from_human_input(previous_span_id=span_id):
    continue_processing(user_response)

# Option 2: Session continuation
session_id = judgment.get_current_session_id()
# ... pause for user input ...
judgment.resume_session(session_id, user_input=user_response)
```

**Current Behavior:**
- Traces become fragmented when agent execution pauses for human input
- No way to correlate spans before and after human interaction
- Difficult to debug and monitor complete workflows
- Session continuity is lost

**Impact:**
This makes it impossible to properly monitor and debug human-in-the-loop agent workflows, which are common in production systems.

## Issue 5: Documentation: Missing Complex Agent Integration Examples

**Title:** `Documentation: Missing examples for complex agent workflows with multiple decision points`

**Description:**
The current documentation and cookbooks only cover simple examples, but many production agents have complex workflows with multiple decision points, iterative improvement, and human-in-the-loop interactions that aren't addressed.

**Problem:**
The [judgment-cookbook repository](https://github.com/JudgmentLabs/judgment-cookbook) only shows basic patterns:
- Simple multi-agent collaboration
- Basic recommendation flows
- Individual function tracing

But my resume agent has complex patterns:
- Multi-decision point workflows (fabrication check → clarification → iteration → acceptance)
- Human-in-the-loop interactions with pause/resume
- Iterative improvement loops with quality thresholds
- Session-based processing across multiple sections
- Dual-system evaluation (fast primary + comprehensive Judgment)

**Expected Behavior:**
Documentation covering complex production patterns with examples of:
- Multi-step decision workflows
- Human-in-the-loop integration
- Session-based processing
- Iterative improvement patterns
- Performance optimization strategies

**Current Behavior:**
Only simple linear workflows are documented, requiring developers to figure out complex patterns themselves by reading source code and experimenting.

**Impact:**
This significantly increases the learning curve for building complex agents with proper observability, and leads to inconsistent implementation patterns across different projects.

## Issue 6: Documentation: Missing Error Handling and Troubleshooting Guide

**Title:** `Documentation: Missing comprehensive error handling and troubleshooting guide`

**Description:**
When integrating Judgment SDK, I encountered several errors and edge cases that weren't documented, making debugging and production deployment difficult.

**Problem:**
During integration, I faced several undocumented issues:
- ImportError when dependencies are missing
- Timeout errors during evaluation
- CORS issues when Judgment services are unavailable
- Session correlation failures
- Performance degradation with complex evaluations

The documentation doesn't provide:
- Common error messages and their solutions
- Troubleshooting steps for production deployments
- Performance optimization guidelines
- Fallback strategies when services are down

**Expected Behavior:**
A comprehensive troubleshooting guide covering:
- Common error scenarios and solutions
- Production deployment best practices
- Performance optimization techniques
- Fallback and graceful degradation strategies
- Debugging tips for complex workflows

**Current Behavior:**
Only basic setup documentation is available, leaving developers to figure out production issues through trial and error.

**Impact:**
This significantly increases development time and makes production deployment risky, especially for teams new to the Judgment ecosystem.

## Issue 7: Documentation: Missing Performance and Scaling Guidelines

**Title:** `Documentation: Missing performance optimization and scaling guidelines`

**Description:**
The documentation lacks guidance on how to optimize Judgment SDK usage for high-performance production systems and how to scale with increasing load.

**Problem:**
Building a production agent requires understanding:
- How to minimize evaluation latency
- Best practices for async evaluation patterns
- Scaling strategies for high-throughput systems
- Resource usage optimization
- Caching and batching strategies

The current documentation doesn't address:
- Performance benchmarks or guidelines
- Scaling patterns for different use cases
- Resource usage optimization
- Caching strategies for repeated evaluations
- Batching techniques for multiple evaluations

**Expected Behavior:**
Performance documentation covering:
- Latency optimization techniques
- Async evaluation best practices
- Scaling patterns and strategies
- Resource usage guidelines
- Caching and batching examples

**Current Behavior:**
No performance guidance available, requiring developers to experiment and optimize through trial and error.

**Impact:**
This makes it difficult to build high-performance production systems and leads to suboptimal implementations.
