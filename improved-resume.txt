PROJECTS
========
Diff Digest | React, TypeScript, Express, OpenAI API, GitHub API | Github
Apr 2025 - May 2025
- Developed a full-stack web app that generates AI-powered release notes from GitHub pull requests to streamline developer and marketing workflows.
- Integrated OpenAI GPT-4o via streaming API to produce developer and marketing notes in real time, enhancing visibility across teams.
- Built a robust streaming renderer using multi-layer caching in React (state, refs, module buffer) to safely handle fragmented AI-generated HTML.
- Created a modern, responsive UI with Vite , TailwindCSS , and Shadcn UI , supporting dark/light themes and animated transitions.
- Engineered an Express backend with GitHub API integration for PR diff parsing, metadata enrichment, and paginated fetching.
- Structured the codebase with clean architecture, strong TypeScript typing, and extensibility toward database-backed caching for future scalability.

ReKindle | React Native, Expo, OpenAI GPT-4o, Whisper API | Github
Jun 2025 - Jun 2025
- Built a cross-platform mobile app to automate personalized networking follow-ups using business card and LinkedIn QR code scanning , voice note transcription , and AI message generation.
- Implemented GPT-4o-powered follow-up generation and Whisper-based voice transcription to capture conversation context and produce relevant, human-like messages.
- Designed a privacy-first, local-storage-based architecture with offline support and intelligent search across names, topics, and event metadata.
- Added support for dark mode , streamlined contact history , and message preview/edit flow for better usability and control.
- Ideated and shipped the full project in under 24 hours during a hackathon hosted by GMI Cloud , addressing real-world pain points in student and early-career networking.

Voice-Driven Productivity Assistant | React Native, NestJS, Firebase, Whisper API | Github
Mar 2025 - Apr 2025
- Built a cross-platform mobile app enabling users to capture and manage tasks through voice input for enhanced productivity.
- Integrated OpenAI Whisper API for real-time audio transcription and GPT-3.5 to generate smart task titles and productivity suggestions.
- Developed a secure backend with NestJS and PostgreSQL (via Prisma ORM ), featuring Firebase Authentication and real-time data sync.
- Designed a dark-themed, responsive UI using NativeWind (TailwindCSS) to support intuitive interaction and improve user experience.
- Focused on modular architecture, API security, and offline-friendly UX to prepare the app for real-world deployment.

ACHIEVEMENTS
============
AI Agents + MCP Hackathon | 3rd Place
- Collaboratively developed a modular multi-agent MVP within a stringent 6-hour timeframe during the Hackathon, utilizing FastAPI, Langchain, and OpenAI GPT-4o. This MVP facilitated conversational workflows for diverse sectors including YouTube, finance, and travel.
- Implemented context-aware agent coordination, adhering to the Model Context Protocol (MCP) standard, demonstrating proficiency in creating efficient, data-driven solutions.
- Engineered the backend using Cursor and crafted the frontend with Vercel v 0, integrating a multi-agent chat UI with real-time routing. This showcased my ability to work with various programming languages and front-end frameworks, aligning with the job requirements.
- This achievement underscores my ability to make independent decisions, solve complex problems, and work effectively under pressure, all of which are key requirements for the role.
